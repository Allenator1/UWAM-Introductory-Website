Each area has a designated lead, as well as up to 5 members to undertake tasks that are associated with each area. 
Next steps for YOU!
Now that we have had an introductory to the team and a little bit about our background, we will now walk you through all of our areas, and will have quizzes associated with each area module. These quizzes will aim to demonstrate which area of the team you may fit best into, and will walk you through steps in which you can progress in becoming an active team member in each of your areas!
