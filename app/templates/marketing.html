        <h1>Business Module: Marketing</h1>
        <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Complimenting the finance team in the Business sector, the Marketing team also serves a vital purpose in the team's operation ventures. <br>
            The responsibility of the marketing team is to ensure that the teams brand is positively represented, and in turn is used to generate the income of our resources. <br>
            Resources that are generated by the marketing team include the teams funding, through the support of our various sponsors, and the University itself, <br>
            as well as the income of new members; to join the team and work to become active individuals to help in the production of our race cars.</p>

        <p>In addition, it is also the marketing teams key responsibility to uphold our branding on our social media platforms, by being active members in taking pictures <br>
            and videos of the team, sponsor engagement, and other events, and distributing the content through our social media platforms. </p>

        <p>It is especially vital to uphold our image on social media, as that can be an active cause for the success or detriment in the team. <br>
            This can directly lead to the healthiness of sponsor engagement, as well as team advertising for new recruits. Both of which carry heavy weight on the teams future and current performances!</p>

        <p>Finally, it is the marketing teams responsibility to devise a sponsorship prospectus which we will offer all of our prospective sponsors. <br>
            This document outlines our history, who we are, the competition premise, our ventures, and operations, as well as a return on investment package, <br>
