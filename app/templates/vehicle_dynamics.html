    <h1>Technical Module: Vehicle Dynamics</h1>

    <p>This area is involved in taking the power output by the motor, and efficiently transmitting it to the ground, <br>
        and utilising the resultant forces at the tyre surfaces to propel the car in whichever direction the driver wishes to go. <br>
        The main subsystems that the vehicle dynamics department is in charge of are the:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Suspension system</li>
            <li>Steering</li>
            <li>Brakes and Accelerator</li>
            <li>Wheel and Tyre Assemblies</li>
        </ul>
     
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The design of these systems have somewhat of a greater degree of difficulty associated with them, as the designs <br>
            will have to consider the vehicle moving under different conditions. Such conditions include heavy accelerations, <br>
            heavy braking, tight cornering. All these conditions will pinpoint the extremities of different tyre positions, <br>
            and all conditions will have to be thoroughly analysed in order to ensure that no components will be under the risk <br>
            of clashing through the cars states of motion. In addition, design consideration will have to be taken when configuring <br>
            different components, such as suspension stiffness, steering behaviour, and different vehicle dynamics parameters. <br>
            All these configurations are implemented in order to maximise the tractive potential of our race car, and hence maximise <br>
            efficiency of output power from the powertrain system.</p>

        <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>The manufacturing of the vehicle dynamics system is relatively simple. Although the parts involved with the area of the car <br>
            are extremely complex, most of the parts are outsourced from external suppliers / businesses. This is mainly done to reduce <br>
            the span of the manufacturing process, so that more time can be spent in testing the vehicle and fine tuning all the vehicle <br>
            dynamics parameters. The main outsourced components include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Wheels</li>
                <li>Tyres</li>
                <li>Steering Rack and Pinion</li>
                <li>Brake Calipers</li>
                <li>Shock Absorbers</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Once all the additional system components are manufactured, all the system can be assembled, and bolted onto the car!</p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>Through the initial design phases, the aim with the entire system is to produce the fastest configuration of the race car, and <br>
            along with this, comes the need to model reality in a series of numbers and mathematical equations. Most of these modelling strategies <br>
            end up being 90% incorrect, as per usual efforts of teams with lack of experience, time, and money. Hence, the basic philosophy of <br>
            the vehicle dynamics department is to ‘take your best guess’ in design, fast-track the build in the manufacturing process, and do <br>
            all your learning on the track!</p>
        
        <p>It is through testing do you get to find out if your numbers were correct or not. If they were correct (or were close to being correct), <br>
            it’s a big <b>HOORAYY!</b> Otherwise, time to get to the thinking part and start coming up with a list of hypothetical causes for the inaccuracy. <br>
            Once all the possible causes have been identified, it is simply a matter of using the car to work through each of the scenarios to see which <br>
            one gives you the magic <b>BINGO!</b></p>

        <p>This learning phase also involves the fine tuning of all the aforementioned vehicle dynamics parameters, with the aim of achieving the fastest <br>
            possible configuration of your race car! One of the most important factors in the vehicle dynamics area is the driver! Maximising your testing <br>
            time will directly correlate with maximising your driver confidence and his/her ability to consistently push the race car to its operating limits <br>
            and achieve the fastest lap times possible! In fact, it is shown that the teams that properly develop their drivers abilities are the teams that <br>
            find themselves winning the competitions! This directly supports the fact that the driver ability is one of the biggest factors of team performance <br>
            in competition dynamic events. There is a rough rule of thumb, that the time difference between a great driver and a novice driver, greatly outweighs <br>
            the time difference between a great car and a satisfactory car, driven by the same driver of decent driver ability.</p>
