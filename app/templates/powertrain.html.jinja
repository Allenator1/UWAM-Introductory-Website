                <h1 class="major_heading">Technical Module: Powertrain</h1>

                <p>This department is involved entirely in the generation, consumption, and transmission of power from the motor to the tyres. <br>
                    The main components of the powertrain system include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accumulator (Battery)</li>
                        <li>Inverter</li>
                        <li>Motor</li>
                        <li>Differential and Gearbox</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="minor_heading">Design</h2>
                <p>Most of the powertrain components are too complex to be individually modelled and manufactured by students, so we spec and purchase <br>
                    the inverter, motor, and differential from external businesses / suppliers, and focus all of our design efforts in designing the <br>
                    accumulator and gearbox. These components need to be designed from scratch, as they are quite difficult to source. This is so because <br>
                    all the market accumulators and gearboxes don’t satisfactorily fit our competition contexts. They are either too big and bulky and won’t <br>
                    fit nicely with the entire race car package, or they are too small, fragile, and underpowered to be featured on our car. In addition, <br>
                    purchasing more external products to feature on our concepts will provide us with more restrictions on how much we can exploit certain <br>
                    designs and ideas, and hence won’t allow the learning experience of the competition to be explored by the students!</p>
                
                <img src="powertrain.jpg" width='500'>
                <h2 class="minor_heading">Manufacturing</h2>
                <p>For the designed components, we utilise a wide range of manufacturing methods to realise our concepts and designs. For the accumulator <br>
                    container, we utilise aluminium sheet metal, which is laser cut from rectangular sheets, and is then notched and fitted together to make <br>
                    a box form, and the joins welded together so as to maintain its form. For the battery casing, we use sheets of plastic, which are also <br>
                    laser cut, and joined together through the use of glue. Once the battery cases are glued together, they are populated by the battery cells<br>
                    (can be thought of oversized AA batteries), and all the other electrical components. The full battery cases are then inserted and fastened <br>
                    into the accumulator container. For the gearbox, the design is directly sent off to an external machining venue, where the design is fed into <br>
                    a CNC (Computer Numeric Control) Milling machine, which directly cuts the design from a massive block of aluminium.</p>

                <h2 class="minor_heading">Testing</h2>
                <p>The testing of the powertrain system has the aims of fine tuning the timing of the motor, so as to eliminate any irregularities in power <br>
                    output, so that the tyres are always receiving a consistent power trend. This is done through fitting the powertrain system to a dynamometer, <br>
                    much like IC Vehicles, and running the dynamometer to output performance data and the harmony between the accumulator, inverter, and motor <br>
                    package. Any wrinkles in the numbers are then ironed out through various electrical and software tuning methods. This is usually an iterative <br>
                    process until we achieve the power performance which is deemed acceptable to run the race car under, at which point the powertrain system is <br>
                    ready be placed into the car, and used to operate the vehicle! As with the vehicle dynamics components, the powertrain is heavily monitored <br>
                    during the race cars operation, and further irregularities associated with the system and its effects on the entire car (hopefully minimal) <br>
                    can be addressed and the proper actions undertaken!</p>
