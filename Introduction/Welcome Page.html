        <p>Hello! And welcome to the <b>UWA Motorsport Team!</b><br>
            We cannot wait to start seeing more of you in the lab, and most importantly, getting you equipped to fit yourselves into the team, and getting stuck into the production of our race cars!<br>
            This will be a mini-introductory module into who we are, what we do, and how YOU can get involved!</p>
        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>UWA Motorsport Team is a group of like-minded, driven individuals who are chasing the learning experience of conceptualising, designing, manufacturing, testing, and racing cars.<br>
            These cars are designed to compete in various competitions around the world (labelled <b>Formula SAE</b> and <b>Formula Student</b>), operating under the governing bodies of <b>SAE</b> (Society of Automotive Engineers), and the <b>Institute of Mechanical Engineers</b><br>
            The team had been formed in 2000, with the team attending their first Formula SAE competition in 2001 and have been continuing to do so since then! </p>
